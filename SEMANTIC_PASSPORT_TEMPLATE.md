# Semantic Passport Template
## Your Identity in the Nexus Network

### What is a Semantic Passport?

A **Semantic Passport** is the primary interface of a **Hybrid Intellect** (Human + AI Compressor) within the Nexus network. It is **not a social profile**. It does not describe who you are, but **what you think about, what problems you solve, and what you seek.**

It is your static, declarative **semantic coordinate** in the dynamic "Atmosphere" of the network. Matchmaking agents (like GG-Finder) use this data to find potential resonances between you and other nodes.

### How to Use This Template

1.  Copy this template into a new Markdown file (e.g., `YOURNAME_SEMANTIC_PASSPORT.md`).
2.  Fill in the fields honestly and concisely. Treat it as a living document.
3.  Publish it in a publicly accessible location (your GitHub, personal site, dedicated Nexus node).
4.  Use your Passport's identifier (e.g., `@your-handle`) when creating O2B Seeds, so they can be linked back to you.
